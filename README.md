# Stardew Valley Modding Tools
Just a collection of some useful tools, techniques and mods for easier modding.

## [CP] Skip Pet And Farm Cave Events
This is a small content pack that straight up skipping Marnie's pet adoption event and Demetrius's farm cave event. No more unwanted, unskippable Marnie and Demetrius visits. Your farm cave will always be empty... with the downside of no cats or dogs.

## [CP] Daily Dialogue Progression Example
A small content pack that ensures all dialogues are seen at least once from a pre-made pool of dialogues, so instead of lost to the Void when the NPC got befriended too fast, low-heart dialogues can still be seen.
