            Algorithm
            The game finds dialogue as follows:

            Event dialogue is read from the appropriate event commands (see Modding:Event data).
            Location-specific dialogue is read from StringsFromCSFiles <location>.cs.
            Else character dialogue is read from the character-specific files.
            If no dialogues were found, the game resorts to hardcoded dialogue from the StringsFromCSFiles files (specifically keys prefixed with NPC.cs).
